# RTL-Design-and-Verification-of-Low-Power-Configurable-Multi-Clock-Digital-System-
Implements a UART-controlled digital system featuring a configurable ALU, register file, and multi-clock domains. Verified using UVM with modular agents, coverage models, and self-checking scoreboards to ensure functional correctness and reusability.
